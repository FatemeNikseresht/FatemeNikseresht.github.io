## Fateme Nikseresht

I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Virginia. I work under the supervision of [Dr. Bradford Campbell](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~bjc8c/). My research focuses on **human behavior modeling** using data streams collected through wearables and embedded systems. 

I received my Bachelor's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Shiraz University.
