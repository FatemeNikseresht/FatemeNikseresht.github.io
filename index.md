I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at the [University of Virginia](https://engineering.virginia.edu/departments/computer-science). I work under the supervision of [Dr. Bradford Campbell](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~bjc8c/). My research focuses on **human behavior modeling** using data streams collected through wearables and embedded systems. 

I received my Bachelor's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Shiraz University.
